# ML Assignment: EDA, Feature Engineering & Decision Trees

## Files to Work On

1. **Synthetic_Data_Cleaning_example.csv**  
   - Perform full Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering  
   - Focus on variable imputation, transformation, and data cleaning

2. **iris_decision_tree.ipynb**  
   - Use the Iris dataset (available from `sklearn.datasets.load_iris`)  
   - Perform EDA, Feature Engineering, and build:  
     - A Decision Tree model without hyperparameter tuning  
     - A Decision Tree model with hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV)  
   - Include a section for Feature Importance analysis

## Instructions

- All code must be well-organized and clearly commented  
- Explain each cleaning or modeling step thoroughly  
- Your submission should reflect both technical accuracy and clear reasoning  
- Avoid redundant code or unexplained transformations

## Grading Criteria

| Component                                      | Weight |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------|
| Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering on Synthetic Data | 25%    |
| EDA and Feature Engineering on Iris Dataset    | 25%    |
| Decision Tree Modeling with Hyperparameter Tuning | 35%    |
| Clear and Deep Explanation of Steps (Comments) | 15%    |

## Extra Credit

| Bonus Criteria                                 | Points  |
|------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Top 3 most comprehensive EDA submissions       | +10 pts |
| Top 3 highest-performing models                | +10 pts |
| Feature Importance implemented (everyone)      | +5 pts  |

## Submission

- Submit both notebooks:
  - `synthetic_cleaning.ipynb`
  - `iris_decision_tree.ipynb`
- Include any CSVs or additional output files if applicable
- **Submission Deadline: June 22nd, 11:59 PM**
